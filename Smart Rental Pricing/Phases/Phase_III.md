# Smart Rental Pricing: Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This third-phase project extends the Smart Rental Pricing System by implementing sophisticated recommendation systems that match users with properties based on their preferences, behavior, and market knowledge. Building upon the data pipeline and analytics platform developed in previous phases, this project adds personalization capabilities that radically improve user experience and decision-making efficiency.

By implementing this recommendation engine, the mentee will gain deep expertise in recommendation algorithms, user preference modeling, and building systems that deliver personalized experiences at scale.

## Project Goal

To create an intelligent property recommendation system that:

- Delivers personalized property suggestions based on explicit and implicit preferences
- Learns from user behavior to improve recommendations over time
- Explains recommendations to build user trust and system transparency
- Supports multiple recommendation approaches for different use cases
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing platform architecture

## Why This Project Matters

- **User-Centric Design**: Shifts focus from data to personalized user experiences
- **Applied AI**: Demonstrates practical application of advanced ML techniques
- **Behavioral Insights**: Provides understanding of user preferences and market dynamics
- **Technical Sophistication**: Represents a high-value, complex system design challenge
- **Business Impact**: Significantly enhances platform utility and user retention

## Recommendation Approaches

### Content-Based Filtering
Recommends properties similar to those a user has previously shown interest in, based on property features and attributes. Particularly useful for new users with limited interaction history.

### Collaborative Filtering
Identifies users with similar preferences and recommends properties that similar users have liked. This approach can uncover non-obvious matches that may not be found through explicit feature matching.

### Hybrid Methods
Combines multiple recommendation approaches to overcome the limitations of individual methods:
- Feature-weighted hybrid: Merges scores from different recommenders
- Switching hybrid: Selects the best algorithm based on context
- Cascade hybrid: Uses one algorithm to refine the recommendations of another

### Deep Learning Approaches
Utilizes neural networks for more sophisticated pattern recognition:
- Neural collaborative filtering
- Sequential models for capturing browsing patterns
- Multi-modal models incorporating image and text data
