# Smart Rental Pricing: Data Gathering and Storage

## Project Overview

This mentorship project focuses on building a comprehensive, end-to-end data pipeline system to collect, process, and analyze real estate rental and sales listings from online sources.

The system will scrape property data from websites, clean and structure it, store it in a database, and serve it through a robust API that enables advanced pricing analysis and market insights.

By completing this project, the mentee will gain practical experience across web scraping, data engineering, backend development, DevOps, and software engineering best practices.

## Project Goal

To develop a data-driven system that automates the collection, cleaning, storage, and serving of real estate listings, enabling:

- Accurate market insights
- Fairer rental and sales pricing
- Better decision-making for renters, buyers, and landlords
- A foundation for future analytics like price prediction and geographic trends

## Why This Project Matters

- **Real-World Impact**: Builds a tool with meaningful social and economic benefits
- **Full-Stack Experience**: Combines scraping, backend, API, DevOps, and analytics
- **Career-Ready Skills**: Aligns with core competencies demanded in software, data, and ML engineering roles
- **Foundation for ML/AI** â†’ Sets the stage for integrating machine learning price prediction models and dashboards

- Feature extraction (e.g., number of bedrooms, amenities)
- Outlier detection and correction

### Database Layer
- Schema design for storing listings
- Alembic migrations for schema evolution
- Optimized queries for filtering and analytics

### API Service
- REST endpoints to access listings
- Query parameters for filtering by price, location, date, etc.
- Rate limiting and optional authentication

### Deployment Configuration
