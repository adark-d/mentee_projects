# Smart Rental Pricing: Data Analysis and Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This follow-up project builds upon the core Smart Rental Pricing System to add advanced analytics, visualization, and machine learning capabilities. Using the data pipeline and API developed in the Phase I, these extensions transform the system from a data collection tool into a comprehensive market intelligence platform.

By implementing these extensions, the mentee will gain experience with applied data science, machine learning, and visualization techniques while creating meaningful insights for real estate stakeholders.

## Project Goal

To transform the Smart Rental Pricing System into an intelligent market analysis platform by:

- Implementing predictive models for price estimation
- Creating interactive dashboards for market visualization
- Building an alerting system for new listings matching criteria
- Expanding data sources for comprehensive market coverage
- Adding geographic analysis tools for location-based insights

## Why These Extensions Matter

- **Data Science Application**: Transforms theory into practical, impactful solutions
- **Technical Depth**: Builds expertise in ML, data visualization, and geospatial analysis
- **Portfolio Enhancement**: Creates compelling, interactive demonstrations of technical skills
- **Market Value**: Develops highly sought-after skills in ML and data science
- **Social Impact**: Improves market transparency and decision-making quality for users
